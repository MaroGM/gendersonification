# Gender Sonification
A thus-far nameless python program to extract data from movie scripts for the purpose of sonifying gender representation in a movie.

__Note:__ This program has been written in a short amount of time by a Python (and GitHub) newbie - as such the code is a more or less successful result of mashing code together. It has been tested on Windows and OSX.

## Python Dependencies
- Numpy
- Pandas (more out of convenience than real necessity)
